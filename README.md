## Inputting a Puzzle

Select any cell on the grid and input a number from 1 to 9. The program intuitively highlights the corresponding row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. If an invalid entry is detected, an error message will promptly appear. Until a valid puzzle is inputted, the solve, generate, or clear buttons will remain inactive.

## Solving a Puzzle

Once a valid puzzle is entered, a single click on the "Solve" button sets the solving process in motion. Sudoku Mastermind employs ingenious algorithms, including backtracking, to fill the empty cells strategically. In case of an unsolvable puzzle, an error message will gracefully notify you.

## Generating a New Puzzle

For a clean slate, hit the "Clear" button. This action wipes the board clean, allowing you to embark on a new puzzle-solving adventure or input your own creation.

## Capturing a Screenshot

Capture the current puzzle by pressing CTRL+S or accessing the file menu. Sudoku Mastermind swiftly snaps a screenshot, storing the image within the assets folder as sudoku-[current time].png.

## Future Enhancements

Exciting enhancements on the horizon include additional GUI features, such as puzzle loading from files or saving solved puzzles. Performance optimizations will be made to enhance solving speed and handle puzzles with multiple solutions more efficiently.
